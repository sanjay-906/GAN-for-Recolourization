### GAN-for-Recolourization
1. A Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model was constructed to produce recolored images for assisting
the process of diagnosis of patients with color vision deficiency
2. The dataset utilized for training the model was custom-created by merging multiple existing datasets
3. The generated images exhibited an error rate of less than 0.05 when compared to the actual simulated images
4. The GAN model was subsequently enhanced to support the recoloring of videos
5. The development process for the project followed the Agile methodology
6. Model deployment under progress
